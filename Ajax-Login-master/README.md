Ajax-Login
==========

A nice and simple php based login system complete with ajax submission, email verification, password reset, and a config file.  Root UI is based off of Amit Jakhu's jQuery login form (http://designerfuel.tumblr.com/post/15555140593/login-form-psd-live) but I added to it with the ajax submissions and a registration page, password reset page, and message boxes.  Feel free to correct any mistakes or make suggestions/improvements.  It is based off an object oriented system.
